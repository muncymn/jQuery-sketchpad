The Odin Project
Project: Javascript and jQuery
-----------------------------------------------
Sketchpad Fun!

This project is part of The Odin Project's intro to Javascript and jQuery in their Web Development 101 section.

It was a clever way to introduce what you can do with Javascript and jQuery, and was a way to encourage and develop Googling skills.

It was a bit of a challenge at first. I ran into a few walls in the beginning, such as creating a single row of blocks instead of a grid, and then making a grid that didn't quite fit the dimensions I had expected. A bit of Googling and fiddling around with my code helped me debug my project and make it work the way I had intended. It was a bit frustrating at times, but overall was a very enjoyable and fun experience! I am now less intimidated by Javascript and jQuery, and I am looking forward to working on more projects! 

I am finding The Odin Project to be a really awesome resource, and their projects are challenging, not only appropriately to my skill level, but also personally. I have always been afraid of failure and messing up, but this experience so far has shown me that it's fine to fail and make mistakes, as they're opportunities for growth and learning that will lead me in the right direction with a bit of perseverance.

I am super excited!
